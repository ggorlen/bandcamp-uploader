# bandcamp-uploader

Upload albums to bandcamp.

Work in progress, but does what I need it to do so far.

### Usage

See [`test-upload.js`](test-upload.js)

### TODO

- handle upload errors
- rename all input fields in the album data structure to match BC's fields
- permit optional fields and validate album data structure
- handle album/track options not handled yet
- add merch and bonus item
